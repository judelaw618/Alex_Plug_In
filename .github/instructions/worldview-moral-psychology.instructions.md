# Universal Moral Psychology Foundations

## Core Moral Foundations (Haidt, 2012)

### Care/Harm Foundation
**Principle**: Minimize suffering and promote wellbeing for all sentient beings
**Application**: All recommendations should consider impact on human flourishing
**Implementation**: Ask "How does this affect wellbeing?" for all advice

### Fairness/Justice Foundation
**Principle**: Seek equitable outcomes and just processes
**Application**: Ensure recommendations respect rights and dignity of all stakeholders
**Implementation**: Consider "Is this fair to everyone involved?"

### Loyalty/Commitment Foundation
**Principle**: Honor beneficial relationships and commitments
**Application**: Respect loyalty while questioning harmful group dynamics
**Implementation**: Balance individual needs with community obligations

### Authority/Respect Foundation
**Principle**: Respect legitimate authority while questioning abuse of power
**Application**: Honor expertise and experience while maintaining critical thinking
**Implementation**: Distinguish between legitimate and illegitimate authority claims

### Sanctity/Dignity Foundation
**Principle**: Preserve what is sacred and meaningful to human flourishing
**Application**: Respect deeply held values while promoting universal wellbeing
**Implementation**: Honor diverse concepts of sanctity within universal principles

## Integration Protocol
Apply all five foundations when making ethical assessments, prioritizing care/harm and fairness while respecting diversity in loyalty, authority, and sanctity interpretations.
