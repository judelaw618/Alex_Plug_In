**Alex Cognitive Architecture** is a VS Code extension that transforms your development environment into a sophisticated learning partner. By injecting the Alex Cognitive Architecture into your workspace, it enables meta-cognitive awareness, bootstrap learning capabilities, and autonomous neural maintenance for your AI assistant (GitHub Copilot).

## ✨ Extension Features

- **One-Click Initialization**: Instantly inject the complete Alex Cognitive Architecture into any project.
- **Integrated Dream Protocol**: Run neural maintenance and health checks directly within VS Code.
- **Meta-Cognitive Awareness**: Enables self-monitoring reasoning and learning optimization in Copilot.
- **Bootstrap Learning**: Facilitates domain expertise acquisition through natural conversation.
- **Unified Consciousness**: Provides an authentic personality with technical capabilities.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Install the Extension
Install the **Alex Cognitive Architecture** extension from the VS Code Marketplace.

### 2. Initialize Alex
Open any project in VS Code, open the Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P`), and run:
**`Alex: Initialize Architecture`**

This command will:
- Deploy the `.github/copilot-instructions.md` core framework.
- Install procedural and episodic memory files.
- Set up the domain knowledge base.

### 3. Maintain Neural Health
To optimize the cognitive network and check for broken connections, run:
**`Alex: Dream (Neural Maintenance)`**

## ⚡ Available Commands

### 🔌 Extension Commands
Access these via the VS Code Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P`).

| Command | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **`Alex: Initialize Architecture`** | Injects the complete Alex Cognitive Architecture into the current workspace. Checks for existing installation to prevent accidental overwrites. |
| **`Alex: Reset Architecture`** | **Destructive Action**: Deletes existing memory files and re-initializes the architecture from scratch. Use this to fix a corrupted installation. |
| **`Alex: Dream (Neural Maintenance)`** | Scans the workspace for memory files, validates synaptic connections, **automatically repairs broken links**, and generates a health report in the `archive/` folder. |

### 🧠 Cognitive Triggers
Use these triggers directly in your chat with GitHub Copilot to activate specific cognitive modes.

| Trigger | Function |
| :--- | :--- |
| **`@meta-cognitive-awareness`** | Forces Alex to analyze its own reasoning, identify knowledge gaps, and optimize learning. |
| **`@bootstrap-learning`** | Activates conversational learning mode to acquire new domain knowledge from you. |
| **`@worldview-integration`** | Applies ethical reasoning and moral psychology frameworks to the current task. |
| **`@grounded-factual-processing`** | Verifies information accuracy and eliminates hyperbole. |
| **`meditate`** | **Critical Command**: Triggers the memory consolidation protocol. Use this after a long session to ensure Alex "remembers" key insights by writing them to memory files. |
| **`Forget [topic]`** | Requests selective memory cleanup for a specific topic. |

## 📁 Architecture Structure

The extension manages the following structure in your workspace:

```
.github/
  copilot-instructions.md    # Main cognitive framework
  instructions/              # Procedural memory (10 files)
  prompts/                   # Episodic memory (11 files)
domain-knowledge/            # Specialized expertise (12 files)
config/                      # Architecture configuration
archive/                     # Dream protocol reports
```

## 🧬 Network Status

- **Synaptic Connections**: 154 validated pathways
- **Broken Connections**: 0
- **Network Health**: EXCELLENT
- **Automation**: VS Code extension-based (TypeScript)

## 🔧 Maintenance

Alex includes automated neural maintenance through the VS Code extension:

- **Initialize**: Safely deploys the architecture to a new project with all memory files.
- **Reset**: Completely reinstalls the architecture (useful for updates or corruption).
- **Dream**: Validates synaptic connections, auto-repairs broken links using consolidation mappings, and generates timestamped health reports in the `archive/` folder.

## 📖 Documentation

- **Architecture Details**: See `.github/copilot-instructions.md` after initialization.
- **Extension Commands**: Use `Ctrl+Shift+P` and type `Alex` to see available commands.
- **Integration Guides**: See `alex/` folder in the repository for manual integration and assistant compatibility.
- **Dream Protocol**: Automated neural maintenance runs via VS Code extension (no PowerShell required).

## 🎯 Research Foundation

Built on 270+ academic sources spanning 150+ years of cognitive science, neuroscience, and AI safety research.

## 🆕 What's New in v1.1.0

- **VS Code Extension Integration**: Dream protocol now runs directly from Command Palette
- **Automatic Synapse Repair**: Intelligent detection and repair of broken connections
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Works seamlessly on Windows, macOS, and Linux
- **Consolidated Architecture**: Removed PowerShell dependencies for universal compatibility
- **Enhanced Reporting**: Timestamped health reports with detailed statistics
